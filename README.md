## ğŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Siddhant

ğŸ‘€ I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Master of Engineering and a major in Analytics, interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications. 

ğŸŒ± During my work experience I have worked on undergraduate student survey data and diverse datasets to derive student characteristics by performing statistical analysis, [Factor Analysis][factor], and implemented unsupervised machine learning algortihms such as [Kmedian algorithm][kmedian]

ğŸ’¬ Would love to collaborate on projects
