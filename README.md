## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Siddhant

ðŸ‘€ I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Master of Engineering and a major in Analytics, interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications. 

ðŸ’¬ Here are the links to my repos where I have implemented [Factor Analysis][factor] for dimensionality reduction, [Kmedian algorithm][kmedian] for unsupervised machine learning. I have worked on diverse projects feel free to check them out and do let me know if something can be done better, I have added the links to the datasets if the data size is small I have uploaded it in my repo wherever possible.
